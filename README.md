# The Otto Theme :lock:

This is a GitHub Pages Template repository used for [@kosalanuwan/gh-site-*][gh-search-gh-sites] sites. Originally, an adaptation from [Mark Otto's WTF website][url-site-wtf], with lots of :heart: of course.

## Requirements
Check out the [@kosalanuwan/devcontainers][repo-devcontainers] repository for the minimal requirements to get started.

## Using This Template
First, you will want to create a copy of this source code. This repository is marked as a `Template` so you will only have to [Use This Template][url-use-this-template] and follow the instructions.

## Build and Run
This site is configured to serve locally on [localhost:8004/otto-theme/][url-preview-locally].

With VS Code:
- Run task: `live-serve` to preview locally

Check out the `jekyll` development container [documentation][docs-jekyll-devcontainer] in [@kosalanuwan/devcontainers][repo-devcontainers] for the fully-blown configuration.

### Enable `remote_theme`
Unfortunately this is NOT supported by GitHub since the repository is `private`.
