In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Originally, an adaptation from [Mark Otto's WTF website](http://wtfhtmlcss.com/), with lots of :heart: of course
- A GitHub [Template Repository]()
- Coded with [VS Code]()
- Built on [Jekyll Standard Docker Image](), and
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages]()

> The site in action.

## Build and run from source

First, create a copy of this template. You will only have to [Use This Template](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/otto-theme/generate/) and follow the instructions.

Next, ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine and the scripts are executable. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). Then build and run the site locally.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd otto-theme
./preview.sh -n otto-theme-preview -p 8004
```

Launch your favorite browser and visit <http://localhost:8004/>.

### Troubleshooting

- Bash scripts getting terminated `Permission denied`
  > Make it executable with `chmod a+x ./preview.sh`

## Publishing the site

TBD
